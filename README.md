# Gregtech ECS

This is a testing project to test an ECS while combining with GT6.

Currently it supports:

* Loading and saving entities to/from json files.
* Loading and saving an entity to/from NBT structures (say for saving/loading from an ItemStack.
* Can generate new Block's via a component.
* Can dump out the structure of a set of entities in both JSON and NBT-string format.

Currently working on:

* TileEntity ECS, this required the NBT serialization to work, which is just now completed.
